This repository contains all the components needed to run the Earudite platform. In summary, Earudite is a platform designed to crowdsource the collection of training data using Quiz bowl questions to improve automatic speech recognition systems.

## Installation

To install this repository, simply clone it and follow the installation instructions in the README for each sub-repository. The HLS server component requires no additional installation steps aside from generating a secure handshake.

## Running

Starting up the entire platform requires running each of the individual components. Running them as background processes (e.g., "nohup nice") is strongly recommended.
